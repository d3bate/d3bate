d3bate is a digital debating platform. It's designed to make it easy to run debating-related activities. 
# Quickstart
There are multiple ways (listed here in order of complexity) to use d3bate. 
1. [The hosted web application](https://debating.web.app)
2. Hosting on a (free) cloud platform
3. Hosting on your own servers
# Contributing
We welcome contributions. The current version of the app uses Google Firebase to host and store data. Currently, the application is being rewritten with a Python backend (using the Flask web framework). To go with this backend, we're writing a web application using React Native (yes, React *Native*).

The backend can always do with more testing. Currently the backend has a set of end to end tests - any additional tests (even if they fail) are welcomed.
