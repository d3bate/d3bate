# d3bate
d3bate is a web app (an application which runs in the browser instead of needing to be downloaded and installed) which makes it easier to run a debating club. 
# Getting started
You can use the version of the app [we host](https://debating.web.app) or deploy your own. We have not, at this time, produced a guide for how to deploy your own version of the app.

We provide a [documentation hosted on Github pages](https://d3bate.github.io/d3bate) to provide greater ease of use. 
# Contribution
Yes, please do! We welcome contributions to any area of the project. Contributions don't have to be code â€“ you can help us write our debating guide or just suggest features or report bugs. If you want to contribute, having a Github account will be invaluable to you so you should definitely set one up. Please check out the contribution guidelines first.
## Non-code
* Help write the debating guide
* Suggest features/improvements
* Report bugs
### Code
* Help us write our backend (in Rust)
* Help on the frontend of the project
    * Styling/layout
    * State management (we're definitely creating too many firebase snapshot listeners)
