# d3bate
d3bate is a web app (an application which runs in the browser instead of needing to be downloaded and installed) which makes it easier to run a debating club. 
# Getting started
You can use the version of the app [we host](https://debating.web.app) or deploy your own. We have not, at this time, produced a guide for how to deploy your own version of the app.

We provide a [documentation hosted on Github pages](https://d3bate.github.io/d3bate) to provide greater ease of use. 
# Contribution
We welcome contributions to any area of the project. Contributions don't have to be code – you can help us write our debating guide, suggest features or report bugs. Event if you just want to ask a question, please feel free! If you want to contribute, having a Github account will be invaluable to you so you should definitely set one up. Please check out the contribution guidelines first. 
## Non-code
* Help write the debating guide
* Suggest features/improvements
* Report bugs
* Help ensure that our data use is ethical (and also GDPR-compliant)
### Code
(Don't worry if you can't program, it's really easy to learn. If you'd like to learn the [Mozilla developer network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript) is a great starting point.)
* Help us implement a Bayesian model to predict whether users will attend debating events. 
* Help us write our backend (in Rust) – we're (unsuccessfully) working on building a simple REST API to connect it to our frontend. 
* Help on the frontend of the project
    * Styling/layout
    * State management (we're definitely creating too many firebase snapshot listeners)
