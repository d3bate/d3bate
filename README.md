# d3bate
A digital debating toolkit written using React and Firebase. 
# What is d3bate?
## Non-technical answer
It's a website which might help you run a debating club, including features such as a calendar. 
## Technical answer
It's a web app (somewhat progressive) written using React, making use of Google Firebase to store data. 
# How do I get started?
## Without code
Hosting your own version of this app will require some technical know-how, but you can use the [version we host](https://debating.web.app) (don't worry, all debating club data is kept separately). You should check that it is OK (with respect to data protection) for you to use the app.
## With code
This section is still being written. 
## Can I contribute?
Yes, please do! We welcome contributions to any area of the project. Contributions don't have to be code â€“ you can help us write our debating guide or just suggest features or report bugs. If you want to contribute, having a Github account will be invaluable to you so you should definitely set one up.
### Non-code
* Help write the debating guide
* Suggest features/improvements
* Report bugs
### Code
* Help us write our backend (in Rust)
* Help on the frontend of the project
    * Styling/layout
    * State management (we're definitely creating too many firebase snapshot listeners)
