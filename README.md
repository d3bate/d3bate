d3bate is a digital debating platform. It's designed to make it easy to run debating-related activities. 
# Quickstart
There are multiple ways (listed here in order of complexity) to use d3bate. 
1. [The hosted web application](https://debating.web.app)
2. Hosting on a (free) cloud platform
3. Hosting on your own servers

# Contributing
Contributions are welcome! If you're stuck getting started, our [CodeClimate integration](https://codeclimate.com/github/d3bate/d3bate) lists files that could do with a bit of tidying up.

The backend can always do with more testing. Currently the backend has a set of end to end tests - any additional tests (even if they fail) are welcomed.
