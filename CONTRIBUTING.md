# Contributing
d3bate aims to be a community-run project which happens within a positive and constructive environment. To make it easier for people to involve themselves with the project and ensure no-one wastes time doing work which ends up unused we set out some guidelines for contributing. 

Contributions for small issues (which should be reported on Github) are welcome. Please add a comment on the relevant issue that you are developing a fix so that the same code is not written twice.

Larger changes to the application are developed on branches. These are developed in response to feature requests (which anyone can make). Please join in the feature request discussion if you would like to be involved.
