# British Parliamentary (BP) debating
## Format basics
In BP debating, every debate has two sides. The side in favour of the motion (the statement being debated) is called Government and the side opposing the motion is called Opposition. On each side, however, there are two teams -Â the opening team and the closing team. In total there are four teams in every debate, each team having two speakers means that there are eight speakers in total.
