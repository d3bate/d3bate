# The justice system
An important question that should be asked in debates about the justice system is what the goal of the justice system should be. In practice, this generally looks like a mix of these three:
1. Retribution
2. Rehabilitation
3. Deterrence

Different debates will often require you to take different positions on these issues as necessary to win them.
