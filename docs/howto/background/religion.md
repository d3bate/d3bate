# Religion
I was once in a room where we everyone was asked whether or not they supported a burkha ban. Most people in said room objected to this. Everyone was then asked whether there should be a burkha ban in passport photos. Most people did not object to this. Many people have a similar position on religion – they accept it and often embrace it, but believe that certain restrictions should be placed upon its role in public life. 

## Do people have a choice in their religion?
| YES (conditions necessary for this to happen) | NO                                                                                            |

| Democracy                                     | The state may be a religious one                                                              |
| Secular upbringing                            | The religion itself may try to stop you from leaving "You leave religion" => "you go to hell" |
| Lack of external pressure                     | External pressures from community/family exist                                                |

## Universal truth
Religions generally claim a monopoly on truth – i.e. that they are the correct religion and other religions are wrong. 

## Pascal's wager
$$
Pr(God exists) = small
$$
- BUT the punishment for not believing in God (hell) is really painful so it makes sense to pray as praying does not take much effort
- BUT this may not work as believing only to escape hell invalidates the belief

## The harm principle
$$
Governments can ban things if they cause lots of harm to many people. 
$$

Based on this a ban on some elements of religion can be justified.

## Is religion good?
| GOOD                                                                           | BAD                                                               |

## Proselytising
Religious organisations generally try to recruit more people to their religion. Often they do this by providing aid to those in need, but only to those of the same religion as them which encourages people to convert to their religion.
