# Structuring arguments
The way in which arguments are structured is important as not only does it make it clearer to the judge what you are saying, but it also makes you consider the strengths of your arguments to a greater extent. 
## Basic structure
Commonly in school's debating, people make the correct claims but fail to expand on their arguments to the necessary extent. A good structure is to:

1. Write down all your claims (points)
2. Think about whether your points can be refactored to make a clearer case. Would two claims be more convincing if they were brought together as a single point? Would some claims be better incorporated as premises of other claims (more on this in a moment)?
2. For each claim, step through the premises. 
    1. Lay out the premise
    2. Come up with reasons why the premises are true
    3. Prove that the benefits you describe are unique to your side.
