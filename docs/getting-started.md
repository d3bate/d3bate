# Getting started
## Create an account
When you sign up for a d3bate account we extract your email addresses' domain name and use this to decide what happens next.
### If you are the first user to sign up from your organisation
 If you are the first person to sign up with your organisation's domain name, a new debating club is created, of which you are the owner. We realise this might cause complications. If someone else has set up a debating club for your organisation please raise an issue on [Github](https://github.com/d3bate/d3bate) or email `me` @ `teymour`.`tk` and we'll manually update the records in our database. 
### If you are not the first person
You will automatically be added to the existing debating club with member privileges.
