d3bate is a digital debating toolkit. It is developed entirely as open source software (under a Mozilla Public License 2.0) and you can host it entirely yourself should you wish to do so. A [publicly hosted version](https://debating.web.app) is also provided.

d3bate allows you to:
+ quickly schedule events in your club's calendar (planned)
+ hold debating sessions over livestream, including: (planned)
    - run training sessions (with one presenter and multiple listeners)
    - run debates (with multiple debaters and a judge) and allow teams to prep their debates in advance
