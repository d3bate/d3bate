# Code of conduct
d3bate is a project which aims to make debating available to more people. In order to achieve this we set out guidelines for how all project members should behave and aim to provide a common understanding for these rules. Anyone is welcome to suggest  modification to the code of conduct, at any time.

We ask all members of the project to be welcoming, friendly and civil towards one another. Discourse which happens in the project forums (such as Github issues, pull requests or commits) should always take into account the fact that online communication can be more easily misinterpreted than offline communication. 

More specifically, members should refrain from:
* using language which would make other members of the project uncomfortable. If in doubt as to whether or not something would have the effect of making someone else uncomfortable we suggest that the best option is to avoid saying it.

If the code of conduct is broken, we commit ourselves to endeavour to ensure that measures are taken to ensure that further breaches will not happen. This includes:
* taking action to make good the harms that have happened
* taking action to ensure that similar harms cannot happen in the future

Breaches of the code of conduct should always be reported, even if the person reporting them is unsure whether suspected events are in violation of the code of conduct. These can be reported in different ways:
* to the core team of the project (email `me`@`teymour`.`tk`) in which case the core team commit to ensure that the identity of the person making the complaint is kept confidential
* as a Github issue (publicly)

The core team will investigate all raised concerns. In the event that a core team member is unable to do this because they feature in a concern raised either (a) any other members of the core team who are able to conduct an impartial investigation will do so or (b) an independent third party will be sought.
