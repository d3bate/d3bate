# Preamble
A defining goal of open source software is to be open and available for all people to use. To achieve this requires continued questioning of the actions we undertake and the values and norms we hold - both individually and collectively hold. It is important to take into account for the interests of all people who use our software in order to fulfil our aim to be open and available for all universally. 

# Discourse
There are several places where discussion takes place both during the use and development of our software. To make this space accessible for all, refrain from:
* Inappropriate language which would make others uncomfortable, including swearing and unduly aggressive language directed at another person or another person's work.
