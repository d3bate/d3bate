# Code of conduct
This is a living document and continually changing. Please help us by contributing towards it! :)
## Introduction
d3bate is a collaborative project aiming to write debating software anyone can use. We provide a code of conduct to attempt to establish a more friendly and open community. We want everyone to feel safe, comfortable and welcome when they contribute to this project.
## Scope
This code of conduct applies to all people involved in the development (not use) of the project, whether they contribute code, help write documentation or provide feedback. 
## Definitions
A 'member' is anyone who involves themselves with the project.
## The code of conduct
All discourse should be in civil manner and take into account that comments posted online may be interpreted differently to the way they were supposed to be received. 
## Breaches of the code of conduct
Because of the size of the project, we do not have formal procedures for handling breaches of the code of conduct in place. In general, suspected breaches of the code of conduct should be emailed to me@teymour.tk or posted in the issues section of the project's Github page.
